# Description
	 In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens.
	 Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
	 The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceutical's drug of interest, Capomulin, against 
	 the other treatment regimens.
	 This document shows datasets and graphs with information about studios with different drugs.

## Instructions
	*Prepare the data.You will need two documents to extract Data "mouse_metadata" and "study_results"  
	*Generate summary statistics.
	*Create bar charts and pie charts.
	*Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
	*Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
	*Calculate correlation and regression.
	*Submit your final analysis.
##Observations 
	Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the tumor size better.
	There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
	As the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases too.
	The bar graph shows that Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested.
